## 💡 How It Solves Real Problems

### **❌ Common LLM Integration Challenges**
- **Rate Limiting**: APIs reject requests when you exceed limits
- **Cost Control**: Uncontrolled API calls can be expensive  
- **User Experience**: Long processing times frustrate users
- **Data Loss**: Interrupted processes lose all progress

### **✅ Smart Solutions Implemented**
- **Conservative Batching**: 5 requests every 40+ seconds (well under limits)
- **Resume Capability**: Continue exactly where you left off
- **Progress Visualization**: See results as they're processed
- **Intelligent Caching**: Processed data never needs reprocessing
